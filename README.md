# Demonstration advanced-apache-camel

This demonstration application show how to design and develop Entreprise integration application, or pipeline application that use  Entreprise Service Bus.
We are going to use a lightweight called ESB Apache Camel.
Apache Camel performs the transformation, enrichment, aggregation and/or routing of messages between applications. 
It offers a (very) wide range of connectors in order to be able to interface with many protocols and/or technologies.

## The use case
Application that expose rest web services on http endpoint to manage personal address data.
* Rest api for CRUD operation on Mysql Data base
* Scheduling Batch that exports addresses data into file 
* Export into AMQ queue

The application
* Exposes http endpoint on 8080 port
* Can accept Rest post messages with a name and address information and store these messages in a database.
* HandleS a timer that
    * Uses JPA native equities to retrieve that information,
    * Process that information
    * Write that information into a file output.
    * Write message to active MQ QUEUE.

This file output or Active MQ queue can then be transferred to a destination application.

## Project creation
The Camel environment, or CamelContext, is a Spring bean that can be declared in the container of your choice: web, ejb, spring boot, eclipse RCP, batches......
### Technologies:
* Maven 3
* Java 11
* Spring boot 2.6.3
* hibernate 5
* Mysql 8 
* org.projectlombok ( enrich java entity by auto-generating Java bytecode )

### Maven dependencies
*  spring-boot-starter-parent: Parent pom providing dependency and plugin management for applications built with spring boot.
   Once weâ€™ve declared the starter parent in our project, we can pull any dependency from the parent by just declaring it in our dependencies tag.
   *  spring-boot-starter-test: Spring Boot provides a number of utilities and annotations to help when testing your application.
   *  camel-spring-boot-starter:
        *  camel-beanio-starter:Camel support for Spring Boot provides auto-configuration of the Camel and starters for many Camel components. Our opinionated auto-configuration of the Camel context auto-detects Camel routes available in the Spring context and registers the key Camel utilities (like producer template, consumer template and the type converter) as beans.
        *  camel-rest-starter: Expose REST services or call external REST services.
        *  camel-jetty-starter: Expose HTTP endpoints using Jetty 12.    
        *  camel-jackson-starter: Marshal POJOs to JSON and back using Jackson.
        *  camel-jpa-starter: Store and retrieve Java objects from databases using Java Persistence API (JPA).
        *  camel-activemq-starter: Send messages to (or consume from) Apache ActiveMQ 5.x. This component extends the Camel JMS component.
        *  camel-controlbus-starter: Manage and monitor Camel routes.
    * hibernate-entitymanager: EntityManager is part of the Java Persistence API
    * mysql-connector-java: MySQL Connector/J is the official JDBC driver for MySQL. MySQL Connector/J 8.0 and higher is compatible with all MySQL versions starting with MySQL 5.7.
    * lombok: Lombok is a Java library that provides annotations to simplify Java development by automating the generation of boilerplate code.
